                    <p>The convergence of social media, cults, and online extremism has become a 
                        major worry for people, groups, and societies at large in the quickly 
                        expanding digital landscape of the twenty-first century. The advent of 
                        social media platforms has not only enabled unprecedented connectivity and 
                        information transmission but has also fostered the emergence of cultic 
                        movements and extremist beliefs. This dynamic interplay of social media, 
                        cults, and online extremism creates enormous challenges, necessitating a 
                        thorough understanding of the underlying factors as well as effective 
                        mitigation techniques. The "Social Media, Cults, and Online Extremism" 
                        project aims to delve into this complex connection, investigating how social 
                        media platforms have led to the emergence of cults and online extremism. 
                        This project aims to analyze the psychological, sociological, and technological 
                        elements of these phenomena and provide useful insights into developing 
                        countermeasures, raising awareness, and cultivating digital literacy to 
                        build a safer online environment for all users.</p>
