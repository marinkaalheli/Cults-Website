        <h3>Terrorist Cults</h3>
            <h4>The Order of Nine Angles</h4>
            <p>
                The Order of Nine Angles (O9A) is satanic and deals with the occult. The group also has Neo nazi and far right ties. 
                Its large online presence started after 2008, but the group was established in Britain in the 1970s. They believe that western 
                civilization has been weakened by Jewish and Christian ideologies which they call Magian and Nazarene, and that western 
                civilization can become strong again through magic. They follow the Seven Fold Way, which has a seven step process which 
                they must get through. They initiate themselves by following certain rituals that usually involve strenuous activity, 
                such as running twenty miles in under two and a half hours. They are encouraged to join other groups that challenge their 
                beliefs and go undercover for six to eighteen months. These groups usually include military, police, or religious groups. 
                These are referred to as insight roles. Followers are encouraged to commit random acts of violence to accelerate the collapse 
                of the current system. They start with magical practices and then progress to committing small crimes before commiting ones of 
                a larger nature. This group has been largely associated with sexual assault crimes and murder. Its doctrine is easily available 
                online. Members have been found to be gathering on Instagram, Telegram, and Tumblr. In 2020, a US army private member and O9A 
                supporter was convicted of terrorism charges after sending the group private military information in an attempt to kill a large 
                number of people. The group called themselves “RapeWaffen”. It supported sexual assault, white supremacy, and neo nazism while 
                operating on telegram.
            </p>
            <h4>Aum Shinrikyo (Aleph)</h4>
            <p>
                Aum Shinrikyo, now known by Aleph, is a Japanese cult that gained recognition after the members participated in a gas attack on the 
                Tokyo subway in 1995. Shoko Asahara, the group's founder, claimed to be Christ and the “enlightened one”. Members believed that the 
                United States would start World War Three with Japan and that the world would collapse. Because of this, they were involved in the 
                production of various types of weapons. The group incorporated beliefs from Buddhist, Hindu, Taoist, and Christian religions. It is 
                still active and targets younger people. They recruit people by concealing their true name and promoting yoga classes and study 
                groups on social media.

            <h3>Cults Tied to Conspiracy Theories</h3>
            <h4>QAnon</h4>
            <p>
                QAnon is a set of conspiracy theories that claim that a group of Satan-worshiping elites run a child trafficking ring and control 
                social media and politics. It began in 2017 when an anonymous person going by the name of Q Clearance Patriot, or Q, claimed to be a 
                government official that had information about this secret group on 4chan. They claimed that during “The Storm”, Donald Trump would 
                expose the satanic pedophilic group and punish its members for their crimes. Members discuss hidden messages in Q’s posts. QAnon is 
                an internet based cult and has been known to operate on Facebook, Twitter/X, 4chan, 8chan, 8kun, YouTube, Etsy, Pinterest, Reddit, 
                and Discord. Members have been connected to various crimes, most notably the United States capitol insurrection in 2021. Many claim 
                that the 2020 United States election was rigged, have anti-semetic beliefs, and are against the usage of vaccines. They spread their 
                rhetoric online and on social media.
            </p>
            <h4>Heaven's Gate</h4>
            <p>
                Heaven’s Gate members believed in extraterrestrial life, that there was an apocalypse approaching, and that God was an alien. They 
                followed Marshall Applewhite, who claimed he was the second coming of Jesus Christ. The group gained recognition when its members 
                committed suicide in in 1997. Members believed they needed to separate their bodies from their souls and that this could only be done 
                when a comet passed by earth. They believed they would be transported to a spacecraft and live in space. Members operated a web consulting 
                business named Higher Source. They used a website to recruit more members and share their ideology.

            <h3>Self Improvement Cults</h3>
            <h4>Scientology</h4>
            <p>
                Scientology was created by Lafayette Ron Hubbard in 1954. Members believe that the basic principle of human existence is survival, and that 
                negative thoughts, called engrams, can lead to destructive  actions known as countersurvival actions. Hubbard created a process called 
                auditing, which involves counseling members to get rid of their engrams. They use an E-meter, which measures electrical currents moving 
                through the member,  the amount of engrams they have, and any changes in their emotional state. Members reject the usage of medicine 
                and engage in purification by sweating in a sauna and having good nutrition. They believe in reincarnation, and that humans are Thetans. 
                Thetans are immortal souls that are trapped in bodies over different lifetimes. By getting rid of these engrams, members believe that 
                they can become better people and can become clear. Once a Thetan becomes clear, they are less likely to be ill, more creative, and 
                live by higher moral standards. Clear Thetans are given higher positions in the church. The Scientology cult promotes itself on 
                Instagram, Twitter/X, and Facebook. Members have also been known to gather on Reddit. 
            </p>
            <h4>NXIVM</h4>
            <p>
                NXIVM was a self help and multi level marketing organization created by Keith Raniere in 1998. Members paid thousands of dollars to have access 
                to NXIVM courses hoping to improve themselves. It is now known for the sexual abuse of women that ensued. Allison Mack, an actress and former 
                NXIVM member, promoted the cult and recruited members on Twitter/X.

            <h3>Cult like Fandoms</h3>
            <p>These fandoms include people who have taken a liking to a person, group or idea. Within this category dark fandoms exist. Dark fandoms 
                are united by a group of people fascinated by people who have carried out violent acts.  They often regard these people as high status. 
                Some dark fandom followers even consider people who have committed these acts as Gods. Many mass shooters and copycat crimes have had 
                this thinking. They try to emulate or even surpass the crimes committed by the original perpetrators. Some examples of dark fandoms are 
                the online communities focused on the 1999 Columbine school shooting in which 13 people were killed. This school shooting has inspired 
                multiple other shootings. Ted Kaczynski detonated 16 bombs. He killed three people and injured 16. An increase of Kaczynski supporters 
                have gathered on Tiktok while Columbine shooter fandom members largely gather on Tumblr.
