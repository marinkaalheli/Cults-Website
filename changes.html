        PM4 Changes
    </h2>
    
        In this milestone we focused on the layout of our main page.
        In that case, we:
        <ul>
            <li>Added a looping cult worship themed video</li>
            <li>Colorful CSS transition at our 'read more' and 'back to homepage' buttons</li>
            <li>Added a picture (ad) relevant to our theme at the right end of main page </li>
            <li>Spaced out the links at the bottom right of our page so that they weren't too crowded </li>
            <li>Got rid of extra space at the bottom of our page components</li>
            <li>Created a mini-quiz that we added to our additional links section with javascript</li>
        </ul>
